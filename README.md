# Man Cave -  Breaking the stigma

Man Cave is a safe place to go for young men on how to cope easier with mental health. Man Cave has been developed as part of Code Institute's Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer as my 1st ever project. This project is made by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Men's Mental Health is a something that I believe in a lot as young man who battled my with own mental health in the past it was a no brainer to cover this topic for my first project.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![TypeRacer Palette](<documentation/>)

I chose this colour palette as I think it is a nice warm welcoming palette.


### Typography

I chose these fonts as I thought they looked informative and welcoming. I used Poppins for any Headings, Rozha One for any sub headings and Enriqueta for any paragraphs.

![TypeRacer Typography](<documentation/fonts.jpg>)



### Imagery

For Images I used AI to generate the images. I used a combo of Adobe Firefly and Microsoft Co-pilot.


### Wireframes

I made my wireframes using Balsamiq.

![Man Cave - Home](<documentation/Wirefram Home page.jpg>)

![Man Cave - Tips](<documentation/Wirefram Tips page.jpg>)


## Features

My site is made up of a Home page containing positive affirmations and Resources and the tips page containing tips and videos with helpful advice.

## Desktop, laptop, Tablet & Mobile View

### General features on each page

General features that reoccur on each page are the navbar, footer, favicon,

![Footer](documentation/footer.jpg)

### Future Implementations

I would add a page for a general mental health questionnaire for users to take when they visit the page. This would trigger them to get help if they mark lower then a certain score.

### Accessibility

In my project I have aria-labels and names attached to all my links for screen readers.


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

## Credits


###  Media

The Images from my site were genrated using Adobe Firefly and Microsoft copilot

# The use of AI in my project

**Most used AI: Microsoft Copilot**

**AI Used for Images: Adobe firefly and Microsoft Copilot**


AI was used in the planning phase to help me with user stories.

I found AI to be really useful in helping me create paragraphs for my webpage this saved me loads of time as I did not have to type a full paragraph myself just edit the ones AI generated for me. Also came in handy for ideas for keywords to use for SEO. 


I also used AI to generate all the images on my webpage, again saving me time searching the web I found Adobe Firefly pleasent to use.

I used Copilot in VScode to generate my header section using bootstrap 5.3 just to see what it came up with and I ended up liking the end result and keeping it the code it gave me.
